# Code_Questions
The set of major question that is done by me full scratch

TILL NOW MY CODING IS: ⭐⭐⭐

***MY FLAWS***
1. I get confuse in while solving problem 
solution: Take time make approach than dry run first 

2. I have to think fast get to the solution 
3. I need to first understand pattern carefully analyze question



***NOTES***
1. If question ask about count of subarray with something (condition) than its solution is:   https://github.com/warcry3/Code_Questions/blob/main/%5BImp%5DBinary_Subarray_with_sum_K.cpp
2. string can concatenate string form: s+=" " NOT s+=' '
3. to convert a number to string than to_string(39) ="39";
4. if a question is given with N nodes and N-1 edges then it is a tree.
5. The best Way Codeforcers store Frequency of alphabet is using **26 length CHAR or INT Array**.
   code is below:<br>
   vector<int> cnt(26, 0);
    for(auto x: s) cnt[x - 'a']++;
